Here, we  wrote an Assembly 
Code Generator from the 3AC output of the Intermediate Code Generator. The output of this is assembly code is in MIPS. 
Here , we have implemented a register allocator,implement the translator to translate staements in three-address 
code to assembly instruction, set up the data regions to handle global data and constants, and provided some of 
the library support for useful programs.

To run code :
1.) Go to folder.
2.) Run command 'make' from bash terminal.
3.) After that run command 'bin/asm_generator.py <filename>'
4.) It will generate an output file out1.s in language MIPS
5.) Use SPIM to run the above output and check for the results.
6.) Use make clean to remove all temporary files.

We are successfully able to convert quicksort.java to MIPS and run in SPIM. 
The string is "string" and not "String"
can't give string in argument
main should be be lowest
if we are using a function then it should be declared above
